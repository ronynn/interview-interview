Some went so well you started second-guessing reality. Others hit you with bizarre, soul-crushing questions that left you wondering if they just wanted to see you squirm. Either way, you couldn’t stop thinking about them—about how every answer felt like shaping a version of yourself.","\n","^And that’s what this game is about.","\n","^Do well, do terribly, lie, flirt, or lose your mind—none of it may matter, or all of it might.

Sometimes, you walk out feeling invincible—like you just tricked the world into thinking you’re someone worth hiring. Other times, you leave questioning everything: your skills, your personality, your very existence.","\n","^But no matter how they go, one thing always lingers—the questions. Not just the ones they asked, but the ones you ask yourself afterward. Did I say the right thing? Could I have answered differently? Did they see through me? And deeper still—is there even such a thing as the “real” me?","\n","^So I made a game about it.","\n","^At its core, this is a game about interviews. But it's also about something bigger—how we shape ourselves based on who’s watching. How our words and choices build a version of us, one response at a time. How reality bends under the weight of perception, and whether what we say matters more than who we are.","\n","^Answers you gave in one scene might resurface in another, creeping into conversations where they don’t belong. The lines between job interviews, romance, and self-reflection blur, twisting into something absurd, something unsettling. Each choice carves out a path, but—is it really yours? Or are you just picking what sounds right in the moment?","\n","^Comedy and existentialism. Because life is a joke, but the punchline keeps changing.","\n","^Trigger Warning: Breakups that cut deep. Doubts that linger. The kind of questions that might leave you staring at the ceiling at 2 AM, wondering if affection is ever real or just a well-rehearsed script. If that’s too much, take a breath. It’s just a game, after all. Fiction. It’s not like your worrying will change anything.","\n","^And in the end? Maybe there’s no right answer. Maybe you were never really here at all. Maybe you're not even human—just a curious web crawler, reading this game’s code, trying to understand what it means to be alive.","\n","^Who knows?","\n","^Press Start.
