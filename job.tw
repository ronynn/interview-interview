# Chapter 1
# Reality Check 

[after 1s]
The fluorescent lights hum overhead. You blink, the memory of the dream fading as the gray walls of an office come into focus. A desk sits in front of you, with three interviewers staring blankly. 

The air is thick with the smell of old coffee and stale printer paper. One of the interviewers, a middle-aged man with an ever-present scowl, shuffles some papers and clears his throat. The other two, stare at you with a look of tiredness and dissapointment.

"Let’s start with something simple. Why do you want this job?"

"Why do you want this job?" 

[after 1s]

1. "I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with the company’s vision."  
[[Pick->int11]]  

2. "Honestly? I need the money. Rent’s due, and I’d rather not live off instant noodles."  
[[Pick->int12]]  

3. "To fund my secret underground fight club."  
[[Pick->int13]]  

4. "Because I saw you in my dreams last night, and I knew this was destiny."  
[[Pick->int14]]  

You try to remember what you noted down while researching this place that can help you here.

"If you were a kitchen utensil, what would you be?"  

[after 1s]

1. "A knife—sharp, precise, and essential."  
[[Pick->int21]]  

2. "A spork. Because I can do it all, but no one takes me seriously."  
[[Pick->int22]]  

3. "A blender. Because I make everything chaotic but fun."  
[[Pick->int23]]  

4. "A rolling pin. Because I’d love to roll into your life."  
[[Pick->int24]]  

You wonder if one right answer even exists for this question.

[[Pick->int32]]  

3. "I challenged them to a duel in the parking lot. Winner got to be right."  
[[Pick->int33]]

[[Pick->int41]]

[[Pick->int42]]

[[Pick->int43]]

1. "Someone influential in my field, so I could learn from their expertise."  
[[Pick->int61]]

[[Pick->int62]]

[if cringe >= 7]
The female interviewer sitting in the middle stands up and walks toward you with a kind smile. You brace yourself for what you assume is a job offer.  

Then—*WHACK!*—she smacks you on the forehead with a rolled-up newspaper.

[if professional >= 7]
The lead interviewer finally stands up and reaches out his hand. You shake it firmly. Or, at least, you try to. 
It’s one of those awkward handshakes—too loose, too brief, like you somehow got the timing all wrong. He gives you a polite nod, but something inside you tells you you’ll replay this moment in your head for years. 

You leave feeling technically accomplished, but existentially unsatisfied.

[else]
The lead interviewer sighs. He scribbles something down, then looks up. 

"Well," he says flatly, "that was certainly an interview." 

You pause. Is that good? Bad?  

Before you can ask, she stands up and wordlessly leaves the room. The others follow. You sit there, unsure if you should still be here.  

Eventually, you get up and walk home, replaying every single thing you said and cringing at least five times per minute.
