# CHAPTER 3
# THE EXISTENTIAL
# INTERVIEW

[after 1s]
{ambient sound: 'date'}

A few months pass. You have maintained your gym routine with proper discipline. There is progress, you never even knew you had abs, but does it even matter, it doesn't for the most part, you leave the gym everyday with the feeling that you can take over the world. But self doubt has become your second nature. Today is just another day. Your body aches, but your mind is even more exhausted. Was this really self-improvement, or just another way to feel lost?

Then, a small break—someone notices you. A smile. A spark. Maybe this is the universe throwing you a bone. 

Few conversations, an invitation to a date, feels fascinating to have someone be interested in everything you say and do. Would have felt like a prank in any other time of your life, but right now, it feels like just the progress in life that you need.

Sweet conversations felt lovely to you when she said she wants your genuine response over a few things, she talks about how success is important in life, asking you why you don't try to become a policeman or soldier instead with all those muscles. You get the feeling that maybe you would have preferred just living the moment peacefully instead. But you have high hopes for this to become a real relationship.

{no ambient sound}

You pause. How does she know this? You had answered that way before. You freeze. That’s… weirdly specific.  

A mild chill runs down your spine.  


This is… unsettling. No, more than that. This is *weird*.  

You laugh nervously, "Haha, yeah, wow, great guess! Not at all creepy!"   

"Oh, I don’t *guess* things, I have my ways."

:: DATE_ENDING_THOUGHTS 

You sit back, trying to process everything. This date has been… something.

PLAYER: "Maybe we're just not ..."

"You know, you're nothing special. I have dozens of admirers dying for me online. I don't need someone like you."

***

For a long, agonizing moment, her words hang in the air as if suspended in time. The clamor of the café fades into a muted background, leaving you alone with the raw sting of her rejection. Your heart pounds, a mix of hurt and a dawning clarity that cuts deeper than you expected.

In that silence, memories come rushing back: the failing interviews, the unyielding questions from your trainer, the moments when you struggled to prove your worth. You recall the pain and the hope of those sessions—the belief that if you pushed hard enough, if you became that perfect version of yourself, you’d finally be enough. The conviction you once had, honed through sweat and relentless self-improvement, now wavers under the weight of this intimate, painful confrontation. 

 But now, faced with her words, all that hard work seems to unravel in an instant.

[[Look at her->tears]]

:: tears

Her eyes begin to glisten and a runny nose betrays soft crying sounds. You lean forward, concern mixing with confusion.

"Are you crying?"

(sniffling) "No... my allergies are acting up."

You notice the entire café is staring at you two. 
[after 1s]
She pauses, then continues with a bitter edge.

"My fiancé left me for some other girl. I just know you'll do the same. He got a decent job atleast after our breakup, I know where he works."

You clench your jaw, stifling the urge to blurt out, "I'm not even your boyfriend yet." You know that would be hurtful.

[[Think]]

:: Think

Her voice, though harsh, carries a note of wounded despair—a hint that her cruelty is a shield for her own deep-seated hurt. She speaks of a life filled with admirers, of a digital adoration that makes her feel untouchable. And yet, behind that façade, you sense loneliness and a fear of being abandoned. The truth is raw: she is guarding herself with bitterness, unwilling or unable to mend the deep wounds of her past.
[after 3s]
She isn’t cruel by nature; her words betray a deep, unhealed wound. Her fiancé abandoned her for someone else, leaving scars that she refuses to acknowledge openly. In her retort, you hear not malice, but despair—a desperate attempt to shield herself from further hurt.

You realize that the pain of rejection, the fear of never being enough, and the longing to be seen for who you truly are, all converge here. Your heart aches with the familiar tension between hope and resignation.

[[Run away]]


:: Run away

Every fiber of your being is torn between the urge to run away—to spare both her feelings and your own fragile pride—and the fierce desire to be the hero who mends what is broken. You wonder: if you leave now, will she remember you as a coward who fled at the first sign of pain? Yet if you stay, will you forever be haunted by comparisons to her lost love? Could there be a future where both of you rise above past scars, where her bitter memories transform into hope?

The question lingers in the charged air between you, heavy with consequence. In that moment, you know that this decision will ripple through your life, defining who you are and who you’ll become. Do you retreat into the safety of solitude, protecting yourself from further pain, or do you dare to offer hope, to risk the vulnerability of connection even when it might lead to lifelong comparisons and heartache? And yet, perhaps there lies a chance—a sliver of possibility—that by embracing the pain, you might forge something genuine and transformative.

***

In that charged silence, the weight of the moment presses upon you. Every heartbeat echoes the significance of your choice.

"So… what now?", she asks you.

1. *"I want to try—let's see if we can build something real together."*  
[[Pick->date_try]]  

2. *"I need time to sort through this... I'm not ready for anything serious right now."*  
[[Pick->date_unsure]]  

3. *"Maybe it's better if we just remain friends, so neither of us gets hurt even more."*  
[[Pick->date_friends]]  



:: date_try

Her eyes light up but her lips betray: "I am not interested in you, my crushes change all the time, just a couple days ago I was fangirling about this cricketer so hard. You should go try find some other girl for yourself."  

{ embed passage:'datend'}  



:: date_unsure

"You just want to jump from one girl to another and flirt with everyone right? That's completely fine. Then again, you spend so much time around the gym trainer I wonder if you are gay."  

{ embed passage:'datend'}  



:: date_friends  

"I think so too, I don't believe in love anyway." Her fake smile betraying her eyes.  

She points her phone towards you, an online admirer asking why she doesn't talk to him as often as before. You wonder whether anything from the past couple of weeks with you was even real—did she ever really want to be your friend like she claimed so many times? You look away.  

{ embed passage:'datend'}







:: datend

The weight of the conversation settles over your chest like a stone.

The café feels smaller, like the walls are closing in, yet the distance between you and her stretches impossibly far. For all her words, all her contradictions, all her shifting moods, there is one truth you cannot ignore: she was never looking for you.

You study her face—the way her lips quirk slightly, as if she’s holding back laughter at some private joke you were never in on. The way she taps her phone absentmindedly, a window into another world where you are just one of many, another face in the blur of admirers.

She was never really here, was she?

[[Think back]]

:: Think back
c3:true
--

You think back to the gym trainer, to the relentless way he cut through your excuses, forcing you to face yourself. He asked if you had the guts to be real. And now, here you are, sitting across from someone who never even bothered to be real with you. But unlike the trainer, who pushed you toward something greater, this—this is just an ending. There’s nothing to prove anymore.


A strange thing happens. Instead of feeling anger, instead of the sharp sting of rejection, a quiet understanding washes over you.

It was never about her.

***

All this time, you weren’t chasing love. You weren’t even chasing connection. You were chasing proof. Proof that you were good enough. That someone wanted you. That you mattered.

And now, watching her—seeing her truly for the first time, not as a dream, not as a validation machine, but as a person, flawed and aimless and struggling just as much as you are—you finally understand.

She was never going to be the answer. Because there was no answer.

You smile—not for her, not to prove anything, but because, for the first time in a long time, you feel free.

You stand, sliding your chair back with the softest scrape. Maybe you should say something profound. Maybe you should be angry. But you’re too tired for that. Her eyes flicker up, but she says nothing. Maybe she never will. And yet, some part of you still lingers, waiting for her to say something that will make it all make sense. She doesn’t.


You step outside. The night air is crisp, the neon lights buzzing softly. A sign across the street flickers uncertainly, as if hesitating between existence and oblivion. Something about it tugs at your mind, like a half-remembered dream.

***

And then everything shifts.

The street bends, the lights stretch, the sounds warp. The café, the city, the weight of all your choices—they dissolve into something else.

And then, [[you wake up->reptile]].
